    "### What is function?\n",
    "Python functions are blocks of statements designed to perform specific tasks. The purpose is to consolidate commonly or repeatedly executed tasks into a function, allowing us to call the function with different inputs instead of writing the same code multiple times, thus enabling code reuse.\n",

    "3. **Init File**: Add an `__init__.py` file in the package directory. This file can be empty or contain initialization code for your package. It indicates to Python that the directory should be treated as a package.\n",
    "4. **Subpackages**: You can create sub-packages within your package by adding additional directories with their own modules and `__init__.py` files.\n",
    "5. **Importing**: To use modules from your package, import them into your Python scripts using dot notation. For example, if you have a module named `module1.py` inside a package named `mypackage`, you would import its function like this: `from mypackage.module1 import greet`.\n",
    "6. **Distribution**: To distribute your package for others to use, create a `setup.py` file using Python’s `setuptools` library. This file defines metadata about your package and specifies how it should be installed.\n"
