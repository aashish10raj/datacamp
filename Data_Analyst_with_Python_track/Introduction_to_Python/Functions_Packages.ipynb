    "### What is function?\n",
    "Python functions are blocks of statements designed to perform specific tasks. The purpose is to consolidate commonly or repeatedly executed tasks into a function, allowing us to call the function with different inputs instead of writing the same code multiple times, thus enabling code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we need to use function?\n",
    "1. Increase code readability and reusability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type of functions\n",
    "1. Built-in library functions : example :- print(), type()\n",
    "2. User defined functions: for example writing a function to calculate the gcd of a number\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In case of built-in function we can use the help() to get the better understanding about that function, it opens up the documentation\n",
